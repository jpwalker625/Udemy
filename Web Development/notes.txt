colors

css can take on RGB, hexadecimal and also transparency (rgba)

(ctrl+e) to pick color with brackets.

classes & ids
 Useful for applying attributes to only one element (paragraph, header, etc...)
 
 .html: class="some-name-here"
 .css: .some-name-here {}
 
 ids such as(h1,h2,p, body) are generally not preferred since they affect all instances and you never know what may happen to your code down stream. 
 Use classes instead.
