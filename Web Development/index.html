            Some text goes here. 
            <br>Notice how it is styled differently than the text below. <br>
            We can do this by adding a <strong>class</strong> to the paragraph tag

        <p class="main_text"> This is a section where you would normally learn about me, what I do, and perhaps some of my hobbies. Instead of the <strong> boring stuff</strong>, <em>I am going to utilize this space by showcasing some <strong>html</strong> tags. </em>
            <br> The 'a' tag is for links such as this: <a href="https://jpwalker625.github.io"> jpwalker625.github.io</a>
            <br> We can add a 'target="_blank"' to make our link open in a new tab like this: <a href= "https://jpwalker625.github.io" target="_blank"> my website will open in a new tab.</a>
